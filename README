== Pivot-time

Pivotal Tracker web-hook endpoint and Trike reporting engine

Trike uses several tools that this project stitches together:
* Pivotal Tracker (http://pivotaltracker.com)
* SlimTimer (http://slimtimer.com) (which'd be much more awesome if its developer paid it any attention)
* Dashboard (http://github.com/tricycle/dashboard)

This project:
* catches web-hook posts from Pivotal when story events occur
* slurps timer data from SlimTimer
* generates reports for us
