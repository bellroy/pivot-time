== Pivot Time

There'll be something more useful here when the project is close to working.

== Intent

A timer window and webhook for {Pivotal Tracker}[http://www.pivotaltracker.com/].
Multiple logins for an instance. A team installation can handle multiple projects.

Update timer window based on Pivotal activity and context switching of team members.

== Down the track

Rudimentary reporting. Paired time vs. solo time. Notifications for {the Trike dashboard}[http://github.com/tricycle/dashboard].
